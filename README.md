# Forward Uncertainty Quantification of the Larsim Water Balance Model
This repository contains code for performing forward uncertainty quantification of the Larsim Model.

### Requirements
Compatible with Python 3.6+
In order to run UQ simulation a user has to have an access to 
Larsim_Utility_Set and UQEF library, as well as necessary data to run and stimulate the Larsim model.

Additional Software requirements:
- chaospy
- requirements of the UQEF library and UQEF library itself
- requirements of the Larsim_Utility_Set library and Larsim_Utility_Set library itself

### How to run the code/simulation

### Runing the simulation on HPC

### Things to be done before each run 
- delete all subfolders in folder `model_runs`
- optional - delete all whm and lila files inside `../Larsim-data/WHM Regen/master_configuration`
